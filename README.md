# Portfolio
- Welcome to the repository for my first ever website build! My general design philosophy has always been to keep everything very clean and minimal as I believe that is the best way to get your point across. I have applied this here and I am very proud of the result.
- On the site you'll find a landing page with a list of links to the rest of the site's pages:
  - about
  - projects
  - contact
- to get back to main menu from inner pages, there is a home button.
